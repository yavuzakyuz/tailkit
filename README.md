# Tailkit

A starter package for initializing a new project with both SvelteKit and TailwindCSS pre-configured.

## Getting Started

To create a new SvelteKit project with TailwindCSS, run:

```bash
npm create tailkit@latest my-app
```

Replace `my-new-app` with your desired project name. This will set up a fresh SvelteKit project with TailwindCSS integrated.
## Features

- Built with the latest version of SvelteKit.
- Pre-configured with TailwindCSS.

## Development

After creating your new project, navigate into its directory:

```bash
cd my-new-app
```

Then, install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now, you can start building with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS!
